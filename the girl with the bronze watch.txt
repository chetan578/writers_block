the girl with the bronze watch 



I was shivering in my coach even though I had 2 layers of cloth on me .it was not much a ride as i was expected .the constant chit- chat of  two middle-aged ladies adjacent to my coach and their 
over excited kids playing around was very disturbing and stressful for me . 
maybe i was looking for peace which i was wasn't able to find in the situation . 
i glanced outside the window .it was dark ..very dark ...i could only see small lights from distant and nothing else was visible of a sort .
most of the people were asleep and that made it impossible to ignore the talkative ladies .
i got up from my seat in desperation as if i wanted some space and silence . 
the breeze finally hit my face when i was at the door of the train ....
fresh air slapped my face and it felt quite comforting and sooting .
the next station arrived but i never felt like going to my seat back. the waited for the train to start .the train station had only shopkeepers tryting to make a living even this point in night but no one to buy anything.
i bought some chips even though i wasn't really going to eat them right now .but still this made the little happy more than i expected .
